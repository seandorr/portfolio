      "description": "I was bored one day and decided to build a custom carousel componment. This was way easier than I expected, so I started to make it dynamic so that the carousel items would recalculate their width based on the browser size. This was cool, but I realized that this wasn't super useful if the items would be squished on smaller screens. In order to fix this, I created a set of media queries that could be targeted in the component prop to control how many carousel items could be visible inside each media query. I figured this could be useful for others and I've always wanted to learn how to publish a React component on npm, so I did just that.",
